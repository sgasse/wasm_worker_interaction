        <h1>WASM without modules, worker created in JS</h1>
        <div>
            <p>In this example, we compile our example WASM code  without creating an ES module.
                Consequently, we have to load the WASM file in another way. The advantage is that
                all modern browsers support this way of loading WASM even in web workers.
            </p>
